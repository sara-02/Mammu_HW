						<h1>Quasars</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">What are Quasars?</font></h2>
						<p>Quasars are massive black holes that exist in the center of distant, and therefore ancient, galaxies. They have masses millions and sometimes billions of times greater than the sun. They are also the most luminous beacons in the sky across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. As stars and interstellar matter fall toward the quasar’s gravitationally inescapable center, the surrounding region lights up in an intense release of energy.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">Discovery of Quasars</font></h2>
						<p>Quasars first became mysteries to scientists in the 1960s. Radio towers were pointed to the sky, but radio waves weren't the only things that were picked up. Also detected were tiny but incredibly dense objects.</p>
						<p>Due to the diversity in the conditions of the regions close to their centers, quasars exhibit a wide range of outward appearances when viewed by astronomers from Earth.</p>

						<h1>Vacuum Energy</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">What is Vaccum Energy?</font></h2>
						<p>To best understand vacuum energy, first think of the concept of free energy, which is something we should all be familiar with. Free energy is simply energy we harness from sources like the sun with solar panels or the wind from windmills. Vacuum energy is also free energy, but it is more abundant than those other forms of free energy. Vacuum energy is essentially infinite..
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">How is Vaccum Energy generated?</font></h2>
						<p>When we think about how the universe is constantly expanding and that the major portion of the universe is dark energy, this makes sense. As two polar-charged particles—matter and antimatter for example—are created, they inevitably collide and destroy each other in the process. The energy released from this explosion is pushing the universe outward. This energy could be vacuum energy.</p>

						<h1>Neutrinos</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">What are Neutrinos</font></h2>
						<p>Neutrinos are tiny subatomic particles that carry no electrical charge and thus weakly interact with other particles. The idea of neutrinos was first proposed by Wolfgang Paul in 1930.neutrinos are so plentiful in the universe that they help to account for the mysterious 27% of the universe.</p>

						<h1>Galactic Cannibalism</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">Definition:</font></h2>
						<p>Galactic cannibalism is the collision of two galaxies and the subsequent absorption of parts of one into the other.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">How does it happen?</font></h2>
						<p>
							When galaxies collide, their individual gravitational forces reach out and pull the other in. You can picture a massive “gravity arm” reaching out and grabbing a chunk of the other galaxy. Except this is a two-way event. However, the larger galaxy—the one with the greater gravitational pull—almost always wins the fight and causes more distortion to the smaller galaxy.

						<h1>Cosmic Microwave Background</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">What is CMB?</font></h2>
						<p>It is the thermal radiation leftovers from such an incomprehensibly massive event. In other words, it is the side effect of the universe changing from a plasma into a gas. This radiation fills the universe and can be detected everywhere we look with the right tools.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">Discovery of CMB</font></h2>
						<p>
							Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the CMB in 1963. While analyzing faint microwave signals from the Milky Way, they picked up noises which they originally thought were due to interference from pigeon droppings on their equipment. This noise, of course, actually turned out to be the radiation from the CMB.

						<h1>Anti- Matter</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">Explain Anti-Matter?</font></h2>
						<p>Antimatter can be seen as the opposite of everything we see in our visible world.</p>
						<p>In the same way that 2 and -2 cancel each other out to equal 0 in math, when matter and antimatter collide, they destroy each other in an explosion of sorts. This makes antimatter very hard to work with, and scientists have only been to create a small amount at any given time. This, combined with the relatively small amount of antimatter that naturally exists in the universe, has made it difficult to study.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">Mystery around Anti-Matter</font></h2>
						<p>Perhaps the biggest question surrounding antimatter besides its potential uses is why we have so little of it in the universe. If antimatter and matter are essentially mirror images of each other, why did the Big Bang create so much more matter than antimatter?</p>

						<h1>Exo-Planets</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">What are Exo-Planets?</font></h2>
						<p>An exoplanet is what we call planets that orbit a star other than the sun. The earth, for example, would be an exoplanet to aliens from another planet. Since the first exoplanets were found in the 1990s, scientists have discovered that exoplanets are actually very common. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><font color="Crimson">Methods to Identifying Exo-Planets</font></h2>
						<p>Identifying exoplanets is done through five primary methods: the Doppler technique, direct imaging, light curves, transit timing variations, and microlensing. One of the most common methods monitors light blockage from the stars. Telescopes in space look at thousands of stars at the same time. They’re able to track “blips” when the sun’s light is less than normal. If the blips are in repeatable patterns, it is safe to infer that the blip of less light is an orbiting planet passing.</p>
